# Binary greedy mesher demo
A voxel engine project highlighting a ðŸ”¥ blazingly ðŸ”¥ fast binary greedy mesher.
Written with Rust utilizing [bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

## benchmarks
There are various benchmarks implemented, but only 2 are enabled. (A simple culled mesher VS the binary greedy mesher).

The project utilize the criterion library for benchmarking and it generates html report target/criterion/report.
